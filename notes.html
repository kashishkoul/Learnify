            <h3>Learn java programming in the easiest way</h3>
            <p>Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.

                What is Java?
                Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
                
                Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

            <h3>Learn Object oriented programming in the easiest way</h3>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. For example, a person is an object which has certain properties such as height, gender, age, etc. It also has certain methods such as move, talk, and so on.

                Object
                This is the basic unit of object-oriented programming. That is both data and function that operate on data are bundled as a unit called an object.
                
                Class
                When you define a class, you define a blueprint for an object.
                This doesn't actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.</p>

            <h3>Learn Algorithm and Design Analysis in the easiest way</h3>
            <p>What is an algorithm? 

                An Algorithm is a procedure to solve a particular problem in a finite number of steps for a finite-sized input. 
                The algorithms can be classified in various ways. They are:

            <h3>Learn Database Management System in the easiest way</h3>
            <p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer program designed to manage a large amount of structured data, and run operations on the desired data requested by the users. The best example of DBMS is Banking. All the transactions that take place are based on a defined software program which keeps track of all the data.

                The concept of DBMS is an important topic from a Computer Knowledge perspective. It also forms an integral part of the syllabus for major competitive exams. Thus, one must carefully go through the concept.
