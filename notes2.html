                <h4>What is Software Engineering?</h4><br>
                The term software engineering is the product of two words, software, and engineering.<br>
                
                The software is a collection of integrated programs.<br>
                
                Software subsists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by developers on any of various particular computer languages.<br>
                
                Computer programs and related documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals.<br>
                
                Engineering is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, processes, etc.<br><br>
                
               <h4> Software Engineering Introduction</h4><br>
                Software Engineering is an engineering branch related to the evolution of software product using well-defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures. The result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product.<br><br>
                
    
                <h4>Why is Software Engineering required?</h4><br>
                Software Engineering is required due to the following reasons:<br><br>
                
                1. To manage Large software<br>
                2. For more Scalability<br>
                3. Cost Management<br>
                4. To manage the dynamic nature of software<br>
                5. For better quality Management<br>
                6. Need of Software Engineering<br>
                7. The necessity of software engineering appears because of a higher rate of progress in user requirements and the environment on which the program is working.<br><br>
                
                <h4>Huge Programming:</h4> It is simpler to manufacture a wall than to a house or building, similarly, as the measure of programming become extensive engineering has to step to give it a scientific process.<br>
               <h4> Adaptability:</h4> If the software procedure were not based on scientific and engineering ideas, it would be simpler to re-create new software than to scale an existing one.<br>
                <h4>Cost:</h4> As the hardware industry has demonstrated its skills and huge manufacturing has let down the cost of computer and electronic hardware. But the cost of programming remains high if the proper process is not adapted.<br>
               <h4> Dynamic Nature:</h4> The continually growing and adapting nature of programming hugely depends upon the environment in which the client works. If the quality of the software is continually changing, new upgrades need to be done in the existing one.<br>
                <h4>Quality Management:</h4> Better procedure of software development provides a better and quality software product.<br>
